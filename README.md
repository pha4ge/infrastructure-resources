*Infrastructure Working Group Resources*

Overview
========
This repository hosts [PHA4GE-developed](https://pha4ge.org/) guidance documents and resources that address common challenges regarding the infrastructure of bioinformatics solutions for the global public health community.

## Contents
- [Rationale](#rationale)
- [Contributing](#contributing)

Rationale
========
As public health bioinformatic infrastructures become increasingly complicated, efforts are needed to inform public health scientists on the variety of infrastructures avaialbe to meet the needs and requirements of their institutions. This will enable sensible standardization, portability and reproducibility of assays and workflows across a range of environments, contexts and resource conditions. 

Contributing
============
Contributions to the documents are more than welcome. To propose a change, edit the source files and open a pull-request with the proposed changes.

If you're interested in participating in further discussions please free to join the [Working Group](https://pha4ge.org/infrastructure/).
