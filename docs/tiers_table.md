## ðŸ§© Tier Descriptions

### ðŸ”¹ Basic Bioinformatics
Youâ€™re receiving sequencing data occasionally and need someone to analyze and interpret it. Setup is minimal â€” a high-end PC or laptop running GUI-based tools like Geneious or CLC Genomics. This is project-focused and manual, with limited reproducibility.

- **Staff**: 1 bioinformatician (possibly cross-trained)
- **Hardware**: High-end workstation/laptop
- **Challenges**:
  - Manual data handling
  - Infrequent data volumes
  - No reproducibility or system integration
- **Risk**: If the one bioinformatician leaves, capability disappears.

---

### ðŸ”¸ Team Bioinformatics
Projects and sample numbers grow. You introduce a shared server and hire multiple bioinformaticians. Most work happens in Linux using command-line tools and personal scripts.

- **Staff**: Small team of bioinformaticians
- **Hardware**: Shared Linux server
- **Focus**:
  - Reusable scripts and tools
  - Still largely project-based
- **Integration**: Limited or informal

---

### ðŸŸ¡ Routine Analysis
Youâ€™re receiving samples routinely and need timely results. Some pipelines are automated (via cron, etc.). Data starts to be tracked more carefully. Sample volume and expectations increase.

- **Staff**: Bioinformaticians + IT collaboration
- **Hardware**: Multi-server or on-prem cluster
- **New needs**:
  - Data QC
  - Scheduling
  - Minimal reproducibility
- **Integration**: Starting to link to LIMS or epi data

---

### ðŸŸ  Integrated Surveillance
Bioinformatics is now embedded in public health surveillance. Systems integrate sample, lab, and case data. Pipelines are automated and tracked. Infrastructure is semi-managed by IT or hybrid teams.

- **Staff**: Bioinformatics + developers + data analysts
- **Hardware**: Multi-server with workflow engines (e.g., Nextflow, Snakemake)
- **Features**:
  - Metadata-aware pipelines
  - Workflow versioning
  - Monitoring and dashboards

---

### ðŸ”´ Production System
This is software development territory. You have staging, test, and production environments. All code is version-controlled. Changes go through CI/CD. Data lineage, audit trails, and compliance are enforced.

- **Staff**: DevOps, platform engineers, bioinformaticians
- **Features**:
  - Structured test environments
  - Logging, monitoring, alerting
  - Secure data access and governance

---

### ðŸŸ£ Elastic Cloud System
Bioinformatics operates at elastic scale. Infrastructure scales automatically with demand. All workflows, metadata, and resources are managed through cloud-native technologies.

- **Staff**: Platform engineers, SREs, cloud architects
- **Infra**:
  - Cloud VMs and buckets
  - Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC)
  - Kubernetes, workflow orchestration
- **Focus**:
  - Elasticity
  - Global interoperability
  - Real-time scaling
